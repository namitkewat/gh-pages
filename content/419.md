I am currently in dilemma with VBA because.. .

I have employed little bit of macros to automate my own project in which
xbrl mapping can be possible with excel.... but its vba!!!

**what i think is....and what i believe is "its easy to create own
spreadsheet in python than to use VBA with python.. ."**

Because.. at the backend excel's vba is scripting language... so
what???  
python is also a scripting language...  
but python is far more powerful than vba.. .

i don't know about all cases but in case of readability and how
scientific community loves python.... vba can't even stand with it!!!

i have searched on google for alternatives of excel+vba but they are not
enough to meet the expectations.. like Resolver Systems's Resolver
Spreadsheet one!!!!!  
If you think like me.... lets join and create something which is beyond
the scope of excel-vba!!!!
