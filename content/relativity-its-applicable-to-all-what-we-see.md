I believes that there are some laws in nature which are co-related to
every segment.  
whether it is physics or general life or biology or human psyche.

All are related to the same laws.  
Consider the "theory of relativity" by Einstein. Very great effort to
solve the mystery of our world.  
Anyway , we know that in relativity means we canâ€™t go beyond the speed
of light. As speed of light is related to mass.

If we progressively increase our speed and approaching speed of light,
then our mass started increasing(as force applied to increase the speed
has converted into mass) and...as speed of light independent(it will be
same if you go in the direction of light or opposite of that) then...
mass will started increasing to infinite. But we can't allocate
resources to maintain the speed of infinite mass at the speed of light.  
SO we can't achieve it.

if we are thinking in this universe then we have to change our universe
, find else universe which has some diff set of rules.

In the very same way...  
In market share warfare, Market leader has always a dream of 100%
market share. But there are competitors which are not allowing him to do
so. Market attackers, followers and niche marketers are always there.

Even then if as a market leader if we want to increase market share,
then up-to certain point it will increase, but after then our marginal
cost will start eating our marginal profits. making our dream harder and
harder (just like the increasing mass in case of theory of relativity)
to achieve.

same in real life... up-to certain point we can face the situation or
defend or enjoy or...etc.  
example:  
we can't remove poverty from the world by having some utopian ideas
like... lets every individual starts saving 1Rs each day  
and give them for the benefit of the world.

we can't just go thinking like above. We have to acknowledge some RULES
that our universe has put on US.

but..  
but..  
as a human nature...  
its natural question comes into mind my as well as your mind ..that..
still is there anyway to achieve those utopian idea???
