Quick Update:  
After the post crisis era US govt is facing higher deficits and
increasing external debt.  
Please be careful that US gov. may take decisions about
"Debasement/Devaluation" of its Currency Dollar.  
So that it can reduce its external debt. Another result this will be
higher inflation in America.

This practice is very common in history.  
But this may turn like the "1976 sterling crisis". at that time we have
to say that "Good-Bye Great Britain". And this made the way to rise of
America as a leader of our world.

Similarly if it happen with Dollar then it we will say "Good-Bye
America"

and the new leader will lead the world, of-course your guessed it
right:its CHINA.

Anyway interesting thing is to observe the whole process.
