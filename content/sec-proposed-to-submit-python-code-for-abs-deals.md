Last night i was surprised  when i found that [sec.gov](http://sec.gov)
has proposed(in 2010) a law for more regulation and transparency in
disclosures for asset backed securities.

But this was not submitting an XBRL or XML source, it is a python code.

here are some lines which might create curiosity:

*    We are proposing to require that most ABS issuers file a computer
program that gives effect to the flow of funds, or “waterfall,”
provisions of the transaction. We are proposing that the computer
program be filed on EDGAR in the form of downloadable source code in
Python. … (page 205)*

*    Under the proposed requirement, the filed source code, when
downloaded and run by an investor, must provide the user with the
ability to programmatically input the user’s own assumptions regarding
the future performance and cash flows from the pool assets, including
but not limited to assumptions about future interest rates, default
rates, prepayment speeds, loss-given-default rates, and any other
necessary assumptions … (page 210)*

*    The waterfall computer program must also allow the use of the
proposed asset-level data file that will be filed at the time of the
offering and on a periodic basis thereafter. (page 211)*

But do you think will industry allow it?

Well i think, No.. they should never discloses any such code to public,
Because its how they are making their money. Anyway this is a proposed
rule.

Up-to this point [XBRL](http://www.xbrl.org) is great; but if python
will be implemented,  it would definitely be a major step forward.
