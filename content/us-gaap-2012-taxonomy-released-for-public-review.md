The 2012 U.S. GAAP Financial Reporting Taxonomy is expected to be
finalized and published in early 2012.

In early 2010, the Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF), parent
organization to the FASB and the Governmental Accounting Standards
Board, assumed maintenance responsibilities for the taxonomy. The FAF
and the FASB assembled a team of technical staff dedicated to updating
the taxonomy for changes in U.S. GAAP, identifying best practices in
taxonomy extensions, and technical enhancements.
