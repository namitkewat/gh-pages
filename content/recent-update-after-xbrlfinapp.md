After appearing my
[app](http://xbrl.us/research/appdev/Pages/505.aspx "xbrlfinapp page at xbrl us!")
at xbrl challenge competition; this is going to be the first major
update after that event!

I have updated the app to use mongodb. MongoDB promotes rapid
development.

See the output of my recent test; its a html file, exported from ipython
notebook.

Click
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_1SHAnqrt8TWklJN1dDbGt5WVU/edit?usp=sharing "xbrlfinapp with mongodb!"),
to see it! (save the html file and then open it in browser to view the
output!!!)

Well, further testing is going on,Â and lets expect something big from
such tiny-tiny efforts!!!!
