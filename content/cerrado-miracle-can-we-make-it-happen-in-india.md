Cerrado: Brazil's Savannah

In Brazil; they have made a miracle in the savannah. 30 years ago; this
place was considered as economically meaningless, and nobody has thought
to change it.

But Brazilians has done this; they turned this Savannah into world top
agriculture land. This land contains huge amount of acidity in it. so
how did they overcome with it.

In 1973, brazilians have formed a public company, named "Empresa
Brazilera de Prequisa Agropecuria" (Embrapa) or " Brazilian Agriculture
Research Corporation".

They went everywhere, went to US and other part of world to bring latest
in agriculture and irrigation techniques, but this didn't work in
Cerrado. Earlier attempt gone fail.

It took 30 years for them to learn, to make cerrado into miracle.  
30 years ago, brazil was food importing country but at present;  
is No 1 in exporting Orange juice, sugar, chickens, beef  
no 2 in exporting soyabeans, maize  
and for your information, all this has been achieved by "not cutting"
amazon jungle.  
amazon is 1000km away from this dry place, cerrado. At present, cerrado
accounts for 70% agriculture output of brazil.

How Embrapa and brazilians made this happen?

Father of green revolution, Norman Borlauge told the new york times that
"nobody thought these soils where going to be productive"

1st they understood that this soil is acidic, so make it neutral,how?
ans is as we did in our chemistry lab, simple,contact it with "lime".  
in late 1990s,they were pouring 14m-16m tonnes of lime/year to 25m
tones of lime in 2003-04.

2nd to save cost of fertilizer????  
for that they bred varieties of "rhizobium", a bacteria which helps to
fix nitrogen in land.

3rd, how to feed livestock?  
ans is, they went to africa and brought a grass called "brachiaria", by
cross breeding they created new variety "braquiarinha" which produces
20-25tonnes of grass per hectare, many times of native cerrado grass and
three times of african brachiaria. 30 years ago it took 4years to raise
a bull for slaughter, now only 18-20months.

4th. .. they turned soybean into tropical corp.???  
Soyabean has native of north-east asia, and temperature-climate
sensitive crop. They did it by genetic engineering. now they are able to
generate two crops year.

from this lesson we can learn; how to improve our agri output.  
we have to invest in latest latest irrigation and genetics engineering.
but use of proper technique we can easily double the output. We are
having 2nd largest arable land in this world and have the potential to
double the arable land by such techniques.

We have to follow- "System approach", means improving soil, crop,
irrigation, distribution of final output. If this is done so, they only
we will achieve second green revolution.
