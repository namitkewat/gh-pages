Yesterday was a great day for me.. .After 3 months of development i got
little bit success, i have created xbrl package from excel with help of
python language.

I have developed my own mapping language which needs to be defined in
excel which recognizes financial facts and their properties and then my
python script recognizes it and make xbrl package.

I have used "xlrd" library to deal with excel, "elementTree" to make
XBRL with SQLite at the backed db support.

I am able to create instance document, schema document, all linkbase
files (presentation, calculation, label, definition) and its up-to xbrl
2.1 specifications also.

Anyway.. i will need help of VBA expert who can make it automate in
excel end(I can do this also but it will take time to reach their)
and First let me create its documentation and upload it to my cloud so
that others can test/make xbrl package from it.
