The effect can be seen on Dollar which has share of 71% as a world's
reserve currency in 2001 which has fallen to 61% in 2010.

To support the supply on US Dollar in market others who has dollar as a
reserve or doing their business with Dollar currency have to do the
same, increase the money supply. (Or leave the dollar as a form of
reserve currency)

other measure can be taken to control the inflation are:  
1. Setting up commodity standards  
2. "Hidden inflation" are there which are not measured such as black
market transactions and Hidden quality deterioration; work on them.  
3. Improve efficiency on the supply chain so that shortages will not be
created.
