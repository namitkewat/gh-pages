Kotler defines Positioning as an “act of designing the company’s
offering and image to occupy a distinctive place in the minds of target
market.” The goal is to locate the brand in the minds of consumers to
maximize the potential benefit to the firm.

A good brand positioning helps guide marketing strategy by clarifying
the Brand’s essence, what goals it helps the consumer achieve, and how
it does so in unique way.Everyone in the organization should understand
the brand positioning and use it as context of making decision.

But wait, we are Social animal! It must relate it to others also. Not
simply between Brand and individual customer.  
So what Kotler's definition lacks, is this principle:  
“Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu”  
Its an African wisdom, and translation of that in English is: “I am
because you are, you are because we are,” or “A person is a person
through other people”.  
Below is the link of Youtube video in which Nelson Mandela talks about
the Ubuntu Philosophy.

Nelson Mandela explained Ubuntu as:  
“A traveler through a country would stop at a village and he didn't
have to ask for food or for water. Once he stops, the people give him
food, entertain him. That is one aspect of Ubuntu, but it will have
various aspects. Ubuntu does not mean that people should not enrich
themselves. The question therefore is: Are you going to do so in order
to enable the community around you to be able to improve?”

Anyway, come to the point of “Positioning”.  
Above description says that “Positioning is relative”. That is someone
can only be cheaper; relative to faster one. Someone can only be faster
when someone with slower was there.  
So, hybrid of “Positioning definition by Kotler” and “African wisdom”
:  
“Positioning is an act of designing the company's offer and image so
that it occupies a distinct and valued place in the target customer's
mind, relative to other things.”  
Hence its very dynamic activity, because nothing will last for long
time. We have to reposition annually.

Example of Nokia; From upper segment; iPhone and Blackberry is
constantly putting pressure and from lower segment Micromax, Zen, BPL
are churning their market share. And in middle segment Motorola, LG,
Samsung …. Etc. So Nokia has to constantly review their Position
relative to other.

Example of “Pepsi One”: Pepsi failed to position it as a Distinct and
valued (Diet Cola). Consumers didn’t understand why Pepsi One was
difference from other drink- and that was the problem.

“Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu”
