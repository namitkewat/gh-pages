We can’t ignore this development. I believe that in distant future, it
will be levied as a tax on the common people.

But I believe this is not the proper way to address the main
problem(Global warming). These are just quick-fixes, not long-term
solution.

Long-term solution requires change at global level, change that includes
behavior of individual.

Best example of this human behavior I found in movie in “Avatar”
released in 2009, in which people from Pandora are very conscious about
their environment and other animal. When such we learn such habit then
only we can able to compete global warming.
