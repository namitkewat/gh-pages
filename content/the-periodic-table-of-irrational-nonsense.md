[![Irrational
Table](http://namitkewat.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/irrationaltable-jpg.jpeg?w=300 "irrationaltable.jpg")](http://namitkewat.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/irrationaltable-jpg.jpeg)

A tick-box for the rationalists, ‘[The Periodic Table of Irrational
Nonsense](http://www.crispian.net/PTIR/Nonsense.html)‘, lists all things
non-scientific, loopy, and daft from Big Foot to Exorcism, Mothman to
Poltergeist, etc. It’s all here, except for maybe Reality Television and
the ‘X-Factor’, but it all kinda make sense, even if it does take the
fun out of things.
