In my spare time i have developed to track XBRL errors which is not
possible through [RR Donnelley eXaminer](https://examiner.rrd.com).

These are regarding some EFM([edgar filling
manua](http://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/edmanuals.htm)l) violations. In my
company we are working for SEC fillings. We have to make them arrorading
to SEC's EFM guidelines.

But in that we are making some mistakes which are hard to track.

To ease that process i made something on python cgi and configured it on
[XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html).

Screen shots are as below.

I know, there are more such modules, which are yet to be developed.

Its been 10 days since i have setup it, and server shows number of hits
to around 5300+ . And average unique hits of about 43 out of around
70-80 systems which are connected in intranet.

These three simple module has saved a great time of financial analyst in
my department and will increase the quality of output files.
