I have created a game in python using [Natural language
Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org/ "Natural Language Tookit") which is a
library in python for processing of language.

I have used US GAAP 2011 taxonomy as base database, which later will be
utilized to understand the meaning of input.
[SQLite](www.sqlite.org "SQLite") will support me in doing that.

Results are pretty satisfactory, with 55% accuracy tested on 7500 XBRL
monetary type elements.

Anyway, it was for fun only.. .
