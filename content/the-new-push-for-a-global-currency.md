This is latest research paper by IMF , talking about NEW GLOBAL
CURRENCY(bankor)

<http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2010/041310.pdf>

At IMF , it is given by Reza Moghadam of the Strategy, Policy, and
Review Department, "in collaboration with the Finance, Legal, Monetary
and Capital Markets, Research and Statistics Departments, and
consultation with the Area Departments." In other words, this paper
shouldn't be ignored.

it has unmistakable stamp of keens:"a global currency banker, issued by
global central bank would be designed as a stable store of value that is
not tied exclusively to the conditions of any particular economy. . .The
global central bank could serve as a lender of last resort, providing
systemic liquidity in the events of adverse shocks and more
automatically than at present."

as we see from above, the same mistake is happening again, and this will
going to affect whole world, and inviting next crisis not from housing
bubble or stock market crash, it is going to be "SOVEREIGN DEFAULT".

we have solution, that is  
"private currencies traders the world over could, on their own, give
rise to a new currency rooted in GOLD and traded by means of digital
media."

but Government cracked down and stopped this solution,  
governing elites have decided that there will be no currency reform
unless it comes form the marble palaces of monetary elites.

lets see, When there will be a REVOLUTION?????
