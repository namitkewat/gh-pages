Neoliberalism uses institutions such as WORLD BANK, and WORLD TRADE
ORGANIZATIONS along with various treaties, to establish new forms of
globally centralized control over far-thing resources. Attempting to
integrate trading systems worldwide,Neoliberalism recognizes property
rights regimes to reduce the power of national governments, labour
unions and local communities over corporate activity.

Justifying neoliberalism is an ideology of "Efficiency" developed over
decades, largely in the think-tanks, academic economics departments,
international agencies and government ministries of US & EU. THe
ideology resolves around the claim that society as a whole will benefit
if it "makes the most" out of whatever stuff is available to it.
