The Global consciousness project collects random numbers from around the
world. These Numbers are available on the GCP website. This website
downloads those numbers once a minute and performs sophisticated
analysis on these random numbers to see how coherent they are. That is,
how probable it is that the numbers are generated as they are. The
theory is that the Global consciousness of all the people of the world
affect these numbers.. . maybe they aren't quite as random as we thought

You can see the DOT and color of it. That shows how random world is
trying to communicate , but we are trying to get some meaningful idea
from that. to see the dot visit. .<http://noosphere.princeton.edu/>

This is proved to be very interesting when you compare with the world
events and the graphs generated within.

You can have access of all those data from
<http://noosphere.princeton.edu/>.

Anyway.. . enjoy it, because mathematics is something really very
interesting and surprising all time. Its and random output even we are
relating it to get some meaningful data(strange.. . !!!).
