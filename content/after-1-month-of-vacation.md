I decided that i will publish tech, computer and Internet related issues
in my blog.

Also i find great software to help me in writing my blog. That is
"Windows Live Writer"! Its a great software, it synchronizes my offline
writings. It helps me because often while typing in my blog my net
disconnects and often i lost whatever i have wrote.  
You can download Windows Live package from the link given below! Its a
collection of cool softwares and they are free also.  
Click here: "[Windows Live
Essentials](http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials?os=other)"

The software will install online.

You know, this "Windows Live Writer" is very useful for Wordpress
users + Windows PC users!

anyway my writings,hope these all will be worth more than scrap!!!!
