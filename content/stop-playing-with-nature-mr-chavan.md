Do you remember the terrible genetic modification bill proposed by
Science and Technology Minister Prithviraj Chavan?

<http://greenpeace.in/safefood/chavan-email/>

The proposed Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India (BRAI) bill is
an attempt to ease the entry of genetically modified food into India and
appease foreign biotech corporations.

Chavan is serving foreign corporations, not the people of India.  
Earlier, Chavan wrote a letter to the former health minister copied
word for word from reports funded by biotechnology companies. Now he has
been pushing for the BRAI bill, which will approve GM foods to enter
India without any checks, trampling the rights of elected
representatives and forcing GM foods on all of us.

In a recent consumer poll 89% of the people said that they held the
right to reject GM foods.

GREENPEACE has stopped BT BRINJAL and saved our food from permanent
damage. But if BRAI is on, safe food is off.

To make attention of wrong things email minister Mr. Chavan to protect
our food from genetic
contamination:<http://greenpeace.in/safefood/chavan-email/>
